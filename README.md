# Kara-Wilbur

Function 1: Just a simple print function

Function 2: I just have it open the file, read the file, then print it out

Function 3: I have the code split the string in the index, then add the string in, then relace the previous spot 
of that index

Function 4: Just takes the list and uses the count function to find how often the string occurs

Function 5: I first find if the name is in the list and if it is, I take the index that name is at and use that to
find the position of the score, then print it out. If it's not in the list it prints that it isn't in

Function 6: I find if each word is in list two, if it is in i remove the extra word, then add the list together

Function 7: Basically the same at 6, but if they are the same, I just append the word to a new string

Function 8: Same as 7, except for when the word is not in the string
